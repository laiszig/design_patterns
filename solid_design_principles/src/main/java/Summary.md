* Single Responsibility Principle
  * A class should only have one reason to change
  * Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent task/ problems
* Open-Closed Principle
  * Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  * You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
* Inteface Segregation Principle
  * Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
  * YAGNI
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
